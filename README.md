###FenViewer illustrates a given fen string on a board

### Installation
works with python3.6 and probably every python3.x version.
- The only dependency is PyQt5. Install it via `pip3 install PyQt5` or using your prefered pip version
- requirements.txt can be found within the repo

### Bugs
- The visualisation of the haskell move string isn't yet fully implement and only works roughly.
- To reset a fully processed move string (every move is on the board) write something into the lineedit to refresh.

*no guarantee for a fully correct working FEN check*
